# Getting Support

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano. We have an active Telegram channel and a dedicated [support page](https://iohk.zendesk.com/) to help you with your issues and questions. 

We are also creating documentation with the support of our pioneers, a small group of stake pool operators. As that documentation is completed, we will add it to the sections on this website. Please remember to check back regularly.

## Telegram Channel: Cardano Developers

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just join the [@CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup channel](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).

## Where can I get technical support?

To contact IOHK Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). You can also click the Support button at the bottom right of your screen. The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
